=head1 NAME

Test::Mock::Cmd - Mock system(), exec(), and qx() for testing

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::Mock::Cmd version 0.6

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Mock::Cmd 'system' => \&my_cmd_mocker, 'qr' => \&my_cmd_mocker;

or

    use Test::Mock::Cmd \&my_cmd_mocker;

or

    use Test::Mock::Cmd \&my_mock_system, \&my_mock_exec, \&my_mock_qx;

or

    use Test::Mock::Cmd 'system' => { … }, 'qr' =>  { … }; # can mix and match hash ref and code ref

or

    use Test::Mock::Cmd { … };

or

    use Test::Mock::Cmd { … }, { … }, { … }; # can mix and match hash ref and code ref

Typical testing usage example:

    use Test::More;

    our $current_system = sub { diag( explain( \@_ ) ); return 0; };
    use Test::Mock::Cmd 'system' => sub { $current_system->(@_) };

    use Foo;

    …

    {
        my $sys;
        local $current_system = sub { $sys = \@_ };
        
        foo(1);
        is($sys, undef, 'foo() does not call system w/ true arg');
        
        $sys = undef; # just in case
        foo();
        isnt($sys, undef, 'foo() calls system by default');
        is_deeply($sys, [qw(/bin/chibby -wibby foo)], 'foo() calls system with expected args);
    }

    {
        local $current_system = sub { return 0 };
        ok foo(), 'foo() returns true when system() works';
    }

    {
        local $current_system = sub { return 1 };
        ok !foo(), 'foo() returns false when system() fails';
    }

    …

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mock system(), exec(), qx() (AKA `` and readpipe()) with your own functions in order to test code that may call them. 

Some uses might be:

=over 4 

=item 1

avoid actually running the system command, just pretend we did (simulate [un]expected output, return values, etc)

=item 2 

test various return value handling (e.g. the system command core dumps how does the object handle that)

=item 3

test that the arguments that will be passed to a system command are correct

=item 4

simulate that really hard to reproduce low level edge case to make sure your code works correctly on affected systems

=item 5

etc etc

=back 

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 Commence mocking

Per the synopsis, you can provide import() with a hash whose keys are 'system', 'exec', or 'qr' and whose values are the code reference you want to replace the key's functionality with, 1 code reference to replace all 3 functions or 3 code references to replace system(), exec(), and qx() (in that order).

As of v0.6 you can pass in a hash instead of a coderef that will generate a handler that defaults to the original call if the first argument given is not a key in said hash.

    use Test::Mock::Cmd 'system' => {
        'git' => sub { … },
    };
    system('git', …); # calls your function
    system('whatever', …); # calls the original system

=head3 Caveat

Any code loaded before the mock functions are setup will retain normal system(), etc behavior. (even if the system() does not happen until much later!)

   use X; # has functions that call system()
   use Test::Mock::Cmd ...
   use Y; # has functions that call system()
   X::i_call_system(...); # normal system() happens
   Y::i_call_system(...); # mocked system() happens

=head2 Getting access to the original, un-mocked, functionality.

None of these are exportable.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 

=item C<< Not a CODE or HASH reference >>

The given value is not a code reference or a hash reference and should be one or the other.

=item C<< Key is not system, exec, or qr >>

A key in your argument hash is invalid.

=item C<< Test::Mock::Cmd->import() requires a 1-3 key hash, 1 code/hash reference, or 3 code/hash references as arguments >>

You are not passing in the required one or three arguments.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Test::Mock::Cmd requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.
